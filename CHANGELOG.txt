==== 0.2.0 (2018-11-07) ===

- license changed to GPLv2, due to ckeditors link plugin

  CMSPlugins "page" attribute. ckeditor_link's templatetag will provide fallback logic for some
  time.
- CKEDITOR_LINK_ATTR_MODIFIERS setting / concept: support multi widgets easily in link model
  forms. see README for more info.

  get_link_style, get_link_target for getting target and style of a link.
